# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.

### 📖 [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development) by Kent Beck

In this fairly short book (240p), the reader gets a short theoretical introduction to the techniques and practices that form TDD. He then immediately follows Kent Beck in his journey of implementing two projects from start to finish using TDD: a money example in Java and the creation of unit testing framework in Python.

Having already attended several coderetreats, reading this book was my biggest a-ha moment in understanding how TDD works and how to apply it.
